Challenge yourself to make a home page like this!

1. Notice how I have a huge title on the top of the page (<h1> </h1>)
2. Notice how I have an image (<img src = "name _ of _ picture . png">)
3. Notice how I have an ordered list (<ol> <li> whatever you want to list </li> </ol>)
4. Notice how I have the background color (set background-color: whatever you like in CSS)
5. Notice how I have all the things in my page centered (set text-aling: center in your CSS)
